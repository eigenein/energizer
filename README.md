TODO

## Why not [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/)?

There're multiple reasons why I didn't like them:

- Quite heavy. Their restart or configuration update takes ages.
- I can't catch all those _things_, _entities_, _channels_ and etc and relations between them. I want something simpler.
- Too flexible. While this may be good, I'm getting tired configuring all those _things_.
- Custom automation syntax. This may be perfect for non-developers, but I prefer to write in [my favorite language](https://www.python.org/).
- Inconvenient configuration. It's stored inside a container, separate web interfaces are needed to edit it via browser.

## General Idea

In IFFTTie there're only **two** terms to understand: *service* and *update*.

### What's a *service*?

*Service* is an interface to the outside world. It serves two goals:

- You control the outside world with its public methods.
- It generates *updates*.

#### Examples

- [Nest API](https://developers.nest.com/documentation/api-reference)
- [Buienradar](https://www.buienradar.nl/)
- [IFFTT](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks)

### What's *update*?

The term stands for itself. Update contains information that something has changed in the world. An update consists of a *key* and a *value*. *Key* is a globally unique identifier which is used to refer to a particular *value* in the world.

#### Examples

| key                                  | value     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `buienradar:6391:temperature`        | `2.8`     |
| `nest:camera:0123â€¦9876:is_streaming` | `true`    |
| `webhook:hello`                      | `'world'` |

## Configuration

IFTTTie reads its configuration from a single file. And there're two important things:

- It's **non-local**. You pass a **URL** via command line parameter or environment variable. IFTTTie loads the file when (re-)started. Think here of a secret [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) URL, for example. **Never share your configuration publicly as soon as it contains any credentials.**
- It's a **Python module**. You can write any valid Python code in there. IFTTTie Python API is described further. **Don't blindly trust others' code.**

## Running

### Via Command Line

```text
Usage: iftttie [OPTIONS]

  Yet another home assistant.

Options:
  -c, --config TEXT    Configuration URL.  [required]
  --http-port INTEGER  Web server port.  [default: 8080]
  -v, --verbose        Logging verbosity.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

### Via Docker

```sh
docker run -it --rm eigenein/iftttie iftttie -vvv -c https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/raw
```

The image supports running on Raspberry Pi out-of-the-box.

## Startup

- IFTTTie imports the configuration module at its (re-)start.
- **All service instances from the global namespace will be automatically run and start generating updates.** If you want to avoid a particular service from generating updates, name a variable with a leading underscore.

The following function from the imported module will be run for every update:

```python
async def handle(update: Update):
    ...
```

### Configuration Example

```python
nest = Nest('nest-api-token')

async def handle(update: Update):
    print(update)
```

## Python API

### `class Update`

#### `key: str`

This is just update *key* that's described above.

#### `value: Any`

The related *value*. Very specific to a particular service.
