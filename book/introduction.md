# Introduction

**Documentation is still in progress and very poor.**

## Why not [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/)?

There're multiple reasons why I didn't like them:

- Quite heavy. Their restart or configuration update takes ages.
- I can't catch all those _things_, _entities_, _channels_ and etc and relations between them. I want something simpler.
- Too flexible. While this may be good, I'm getting tired configuring all those _things_.
- Custom automation syntax. This may be perfect for non-developers, but I prefer to write in [my favorite language](https://www.python.org/).
- Inconvenient configuration. It's stored inside a container, separate web interfaces are needed to edit it via browser.
